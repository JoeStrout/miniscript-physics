### 2D physics package for MiniScript (especially Mini Micro)

This is a very early project to create a 2D physics package for [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org).  Initially we are targeting [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/), though it should work with [Soda](https://github.com/JoeStrout/soda) too.

The goal is to produce enough of a physics engine to support games like _Angry Birds_ and _Crush the Castle_.

## Current State

We have a functional physics core now, including collision response, involving both circles and rectangles.  Run the `test.ms` program to see various test scenarios.

## Help Wanted

Help in this project is very much appreciated!  Please see the [open issues](https://github.com/JoeStrout/miniscript-physics/issues) and pitch in where you can.
